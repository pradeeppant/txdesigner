                <dd><strong><em>tx</em>DESIGNER</strong> is an intuitive application for visualizing the study design during the protocol design, study build and during submission phase, streamlining the clinical trial process and helping life sciences organizations optimize their R&amp;D investments and time.</dd>

                <dd><strong><em>tx</em>DESIGNER</strong> maps the Visit, Form, Field and the corresponding validation details from ALS and generates the CRFs in a PDF format which can be used as specification for trial build, regulatory submission and archival purpose.</dd>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The clinical science team gets to visualize the actual study prior to being built, also eliminates the need to learn EDC platform</li>
                        <li>Protocol development and design phases become visual, offers great deal of clarity during the trial realization phase thus reducing the time span</li>
                        <li>Address the collaboration challenges during the protocol writing phase in a geographically distributed teams</li>
