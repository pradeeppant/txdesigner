  		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Your privacy is very important to txDESIGNER</h2>
        <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how txDESIGNER collects information from all Visitors ("Visitors") to txDESIGNER's online ("Internet") application, those who access our site and the information therein and what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors have concerning the collection and use of such information. txDESIGNER requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
        <p><span>Introduction</span> txDESIGNER collects information in different ways from Visitors who access the various parts of our online website <a href="www.txdesigner.us">www.txdesigner.us</a> and the information and offers therein. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as You use our website and, we do not share this information with third parties.</p>
        <p><span>txDESIGNER's Partners</span> From time to time, some offers and services may be offered to Visitors in conjunction with a partner (e.g. professional associates). To provide Visitors with some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, we will provide such data collected or transferred to our partners but not personally identifiable information of individual Visitor.</p>
        <p><span>The Information We Collect And Store</span> 
        We may collect and store the following information when running the txDESIGNER Service:<br /><br />
        <span class="italic">Information You Provide.</span> When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. When you invite others to join txDESIGNER by using our referral page, we send them a one-time email for that referral. You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer txDESIGNER to you.<br /><br />
        <span class="italic">Files.</span> We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the txDESIGNER Service (“Files”). If you add a file to your txDESIGNER that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.<br /><br />
        <span class="italic">Log Data.</span>  When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.<br /><br />
        <span class="italic">Cookies.</span>  We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.       
        </p>
        <p><span>How We Use Personal Information</span>
        	<span class="italic">Personal Information.</span>In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information.<br /><br />
            <span class="italic">Geo-Location Information.</span> Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Some photos and videos you place in txDESIGNER may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. If you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them. If you don’t want to store location data in your photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.<br /><br />
            <span class="italic">Analytics.</span>We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics.
        </p>
        
        <p><span>Information Sharing and Disclosure</span>
        	<span class="italic">Your Use.</span>We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile information at any time. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.<br /><br />
            <span class="italic">Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.</span>We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />
            <span class="italic">Third-Party Applications.</span>We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.<br /><br />
            <span class="italic">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of txDESIGNER's Rights.</span>We may disclose to parties outside txDESIGNER files stored in your txDESIGNER and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of txDESIGNER or its users; or (d) to protect txDESIGNER’s property rights. If we provide your txDESIGNER files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove txDESIGNER’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, txDESIGNER will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on txDESIGNER.<br /><br />
            <span class="italic">Business Transfers.</span>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.<br /><br />
            <span class="italic">Non-private or Non-Personal Information.</span>We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service. 
        </p>
        
        <p><span>Service Providers</span> We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal information to our affiliates and other third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, as discussed above, we may use service providers to administer surveys, and run our promotions. Your personal information may be maintained and processed by our affiliates and other third party service providers in the US or other jurisdictions. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
        <p><span>Special Cases</span> It is txDESIGNER's policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors in ways unrelated to the ones described above without your consent. However, txDESIGNER, or our service providers, may disclose personal information about Visitors or information regarding your use of <a href="www.txdesigner.us">www.txdesigner.us</a> to comply with US, Canadian or other laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests or demands for such information; or in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order; to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law.</p>
        <p><span>"Cookies" and How txDESIGNER Uses Them</span> A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. txDESIGNER may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any Visitor information. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, if you decide not to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of <a href="www.txdesigner.us">www.txdesigner.us</a></p>
        <p><span>Statistics</span> We use information gathered from our site statistics (for example, Visitor email addresses) to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website site, or to gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our site and make your browsing more enjoyable.</p>
        <p><span>txDESIGNER's Commitment to Children's Privacy.</span> Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. While we make every effort to ensure that <a href="www.txdesigner.us">www.txdesigner.us</a> is age-appropriate, we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision.</p>
        <p><span>txDESIGNER's Commitment to Data Security</span> The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).<br /><br />

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can view our Security Overview Page or contact us at <a href="mailto:support@txdesigner.us">support@txdesigner.us</a>.</p>
